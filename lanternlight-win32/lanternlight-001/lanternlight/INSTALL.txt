
Prerequisites for Building lanternlight on Windows (win32) :
============================================================
OpenSceneGraph (headers and .libs are included), OpenGL (also included, see
include/ and lib/ and lib.dll/ directories in this directory)

The supported version of OSG (OpenSceneGraph is 3.0.1.

Installation and Compilation :
==============================
You better use the provided libraries and header files of lanternlight,
which have been modified for better compilation on Windows. The libraries are
for x86 Windows.

OpenGL binary dll libraries can be found at : 
http://blog.lloydsparkes.co.uk/2010/01/opengl-mesa3d-programming-in-visual-studio/
SDL binary dll libraries can be found at http://www.libsdl.org/ (These are
version 1.2 and aer usually called SDL-devel-xxx.zip)

NOTE : dll libraries are present in this project's lib.dll directory,
you can use them by copying them into your Windows PATH (e.g. C:\Windows\)

edit GAMEFILEROOT to your "./pics/" top directory in lanternconfig.h (in bessie directory)

Loading into the eclipse C/C++ IDE :
====================================

Load the top directory (where this file is, usually called 
lanternlight-001/) in a new project in eclipse, right-click on the project
then click "refresh" and build & run. If you add files or something always 
refresh your lanternlight-001 directory and make sure the .libs get linked in
by clicking Properties->C/C++ build->linker and then adding the lib/ directory.

Enjoy, happy hacking.
